Step 1: Go to New Project
After signing in to your Azure DevOps account, you will be taken to the organization dashboard. On this page, look for the option to create a new project. Clicking on "New Project" will allow you to start setting up a dedicated space where you can manage code, pipelines, and other resources related to your work. This project acts as the main container for your repositories and configurations.

Step 2: Enter the name of the project
In the project creation form, you will need to enter a suitable name for your project. Choose a name that clearly represents the purpose of the project so it is easy to identify later. You can also provide a description to give more context about what the project is about. Additionally, you may configure visibility (public or private) and select options such as version control (Git or Team Foundation Version Control). Once the details are filled in, confirm to create the project.

Step 3: Import an existing repository or initialize an empty repository and commit your code
Once the project is created, you will be given the option to set up the repository. If you already have a repository hosted on another platform like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, you can use the "Import Repository" option to bring your code into Azure DevOps. Alternatively, if you are starting fresh, you can initialize an empty repository. This will create a blank Git repository inside your project where you can begin adding files and committing code. After initialization or import, you can clone the repository to your local system, add your code, and push it back to Azure DevOps.

Step 4: Verify your repository
After completing the setup, you should now see your repository listed under the project. If you imported an existing repository, all the branches, commits, and files will appear. If you initialized a new repository, you will at least see the default files like README.md or .gitignore (if chosen). This confirms that your repository is ready to be used for development and collaboration.
