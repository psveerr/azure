Terraform Security Compliance, Linting, Cost Estimation, and Cost Difference

To ensure that your Terraform code is secure, reusable, and cost-efficient, you can add additional checks in your Azure Pipeline. These checks include compliance validation, linting, cost estimation, and cost difference analysis.

Step 1: Add Compliance, Linting, and Cost Tasks
Begin by adding tasks for security compliance, linting, cost estimation, and cost difference into your pipeline. These tasks will enhance the quality and maintainability of your Terraform code while also providing insights into cost impact.

Step 2: Security Compliance with TFSEC
TFSEC is used as a Terraform compliance tool to check for security issues in your infrastructure code. You can also create custom compliance checks to enforce organizational standards. These custom checks can ensure requirements such as mandatory resource tags, specific regions, or naming conventions. By applying these rules, your code adheres to best practices and security guidelines before deployment.

Step 3: Linting with TFLINT
TFLINT is a linting tool for Terraform that helps identify potential errors and enforces coding standards. Running linting ensures that your Terraform files are consistent, follow recommended patterns, and avoid common mistakes. This step improves code quality and reduces the risk of deployment failures.

Step 4: Cost Estimation with Infracost
Infracost provides cost visibility by estimating the monthly expenses of the infrastructure defined in your Terraform code. To use Infracost, you need to register and generate an API key. For best security practices, store the API key as a variable in your pipeline rather than exposing it directly in your configuration. Running cost estimation allows you to understand the financial impact of your infrastructure changes before applying them.

Step 5: Cost Difference Analysis
In addition to cost estimation, Infracost can calculate the cost difference between your current deployed infrastructure and the desired changes defined in your Terraform plan. This highlights the increase or decrease in costs due to modifications, helping you make more informed decisions about resource allocation.
