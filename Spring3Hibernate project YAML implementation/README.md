I recently worked on setting up a CI pipeline in Azure DevOps for the Spring3Hibernate project (https://github.com/opstree/spring3hibernate).

The project was originally configured with a MySQL dependency, but instead of provisioning a database, I focused on ensuring a smooth build and artifact generation process.

Hereâ€™s what I implemented:

-Pipeline Setup

Configured a YAML pipeline in Azure DevOps

Used a self-hosted agent pool (veer-meow) with Java 8 and Maven pre-installed. Ensured compatibility with the existing project without modifying the source repo.

-Build Process

Maven was used to compile and package the project

Successfully generated files in the target directory

Artifacts Management

Published the packaged files as Azure Pipeline Artifacts

This makes the output reusable across environments and further pipeline stages, while keeping the build process lightweight


-Verdict

 Even without a dedicated database service, pipelines can still deliver reliable, portable artifacts by adjusting build strategies. Leveraging Azure DevOps YAML pipelines and self-hosted agents provided flexibility and control over the build process.
