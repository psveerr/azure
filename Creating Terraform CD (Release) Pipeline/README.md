Now itâ€™s time to deploy our Terraform code.
The Release (Terraform-CD) pipeline will only be triggered once the CI pipeline has successfully passed all checks. After the CI pipeline finishes, it generates a Release Artifact which auto-triggers the CD pipeline.

Step 1: Go to Release Pipeline under the Pipeline section and choose the latest artifact from the Terraform-CI pipeline.

Step 2: Configure the Continuous Deployment Trigger. Enable the CD trigger and set it to use the Main branch as the build branch.
