Terraform Initializing, Validating, and Planning

To work with Terraform effectively in your Azure DevOps pipeline, you need to initialize the configuration, validate the code, and then generate a plan. These steps ensure that your infrastructure code is properly set up, tested for errors, and ready for execution.

Step 1: Add Terraform Tasks to the Pipeline
Begin by adding the required Terraform tasks to your Azure Pipeline. These tasks will handle the initialization, validation, and planning of your Terraform configuration files.

Step 2: Terraform Init
The initialization step prepares your working directory for Terraform operations. At this stage, you also need to authorize your Azure subscription so that Terraform can use your backend storage for managing the state file. The backend state file is crucial for maintaining a consistent and stable configuration of your infrastructure. Make sure you have a Blob Storage container available in your Azure subscription to store the state file.

Step 3: Terraform Validate
The validation step checks your Terraform configuration files to ensure there are no syntax errors or invalid arguments. Running validation confirms that your code is correctly written and that Terraform will be able to process it without issues. This step is important to catch problems early before proceeding with infrastructure planning or deployment.

Step 4: Terraform Plan
The planning step creates an execution plan that shows the actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state of your infrastructure. During this process, Terraform compares the current state with your configuration and outputs the changes it intends to make. In addition, a plan output file is generated for later use. You also need to provide your Azure subscription details again during this step to allow Terraform to connect to your environment.
