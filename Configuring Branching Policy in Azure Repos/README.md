Branching policies are required to protect the main/master branch from unwanted commits.
Any changes to the main/master branch can only be done through a Pull Request.

It is also important to note that the Terraform-CD (Release) pipeline will only be triggered if the Terraform-CI (Build) pipeline was triggered from the main branch.
